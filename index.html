    <h2>About Me</h2>

    <p>My name is Scott-Russell Clark, I am currently working as a forklift driver at St.Austell Brewery.
        My past roles have included working in the military, production, warehouse distribution and 
        delivery driving. During my employment I have gained valuable life experiences and skills including
        advanced driving, basic coding, and team building. I am currently studying Higher Education in 
        Computing and IT in my own time with the Open University. I take pride in getting work done 
        efficiently and to a high standard either working on my own or as part of a team. I am keen to work 
        in the tech sector as a web designer, and to work my way up to a web developer. I am dedicated, and 
        willing to travel. I hold a full UK driving licence.</p>
